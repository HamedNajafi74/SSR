modal analysis on a rotor system to determine the natural torsional frequencies and mode shapes of the system
# 
This code performs modal analysis on a rotor system to determine the natural
torsional frequencies and mode shapes of the system. The rotor system consists of
multiple parts connected by torsional stiffness elements. The code calculates the
torsional stiffness matrix (K) and torsional mass matrix (M) based on user-defined input
for the number of rotor parts, their masses, and the stiffness between them. The
eigenvalue problem is then solved to obtain the eigenvalues (L) and eigenvectors (V) of
the system. From the eigenvalues, the natural frequencies (Freqs) of torsional
oscillations are computed.
